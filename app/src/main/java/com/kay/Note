Task

How to put in query values to database:
INSERT INTO todo_table(id, title, description, priority) VALUES(2, "I am pro developer", "I am so awesome", "MEDIUM" )

(1) add dependency
(2) Create 2 first Model classes
    -> Create EntityClass
    -> create a custom Enum class with all the priorities colors.
    -> create some constants objects which contains Database table name and the database name.
    -> add some color resources for our priorities.

(3) Setup Room Database.
    -> Create Entity table
    -> Create DAO with our queries
    -> Create a Database
    -> create an Enum Class with our priorities colors.

(4) Setup Dagger Hilt.
    -> create the application class
    -> declare name in manifest.

(5) Create Repository

(6) Create ViewModel

(7) setup navigation component with compose
    -> setup navigation with navHost
    -> create two navigation graph destination

CRUID OPERATIONS

ADD TASK ->
(Some setup before adding values to our database)

(1) Change Lambda in ListComposable (navBackStackEntry)
(2) In Action Enum class. Create a extension function which will convert a sting to the enumClass action
    -> this function will be on an extension nullable string and return action (fun String.?toAction (): Action)
    -> use a return when statement, and when this (String) is equal to the specific enum class "name" then return Action.name
    -> else block should be NO_ACTION
(3) Create a val action which should be our navBackStackEntry and calls arguments? which call the getString() function with the LIST_ARGUMENT_KEY passed in.
    -> this should call the function toAction which we just create in enum class.
    -> check this this with Log.d("ListComposable", action.name)
